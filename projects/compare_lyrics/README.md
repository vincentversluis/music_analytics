# Visualise tours

This project attempts to investigate artists' lyrics by metrics, using data from [Genius](https://genius.com/).

The retrieval and feature engineering stage is done separete in [0_get_data.py](0_get_data.py), as the next steps fork into [1_find_similar_artists.py](1_find_similar_artists.py), which focuses on finding a similar artist by lyrics and [1_visualise_artists.py](1_visualise_artists.py), in which I attempt to visualise the wonderful range of emotional and lyrical characteristics the metal I listen to has to offer.
